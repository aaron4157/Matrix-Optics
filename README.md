# Matrix-Optics
Ray-tracing tool kit
Incorporate paraaxial approximation.
Include most-used matrices of optical interfaces
Assembly these blocks and find ray modification after any lens system!
Notion:
r = height(y) from central axis
th = slope; it becomes negative as ray goes down-ward and cross the central axis.
a ball-shapped lens(n>1) is defined having positive curvature.
